   **We**, the **TechnoSavvyCrats** developed the ***projectCalcula – the Calculator.*** 
   This team has five determined techno-learners namely *Paul, Brian, Rhae, Faith, and Kim.*



## >Libraries ##

We used **Python 3.7.9** as our programming language, then ***PyParsing*** and ***Tkinter*** as our main libraries for the calculator logic and GUI Framework respectively.

 ## >Features ##

This calculator application have additional features which can perform some of the trigonometric, logarithmic and algebraic functions together with the basic functions of a calculator.
